## Meeting Notes
- Before we send out survey, should have the AHS guidelines visible to help the user make seat selections
- Legend/heatmap could have additional info such as what the infection rates mean, hovering over to show the values, terminology from the papers, links to the papers, etc
- Scientific level of our model is acceptable for the scope of the project but Philip did provide some suggestions to improve it:
    - compound fit using both exponentials and polynomials
    - reframe fitting into 2d
    - almost elliptical shape of influence
    - gaussian blur equation
    - Make sure data past 2m is sensible
- Our main contribution for this project is to create the interface 
- Implementation of framework should be open and modular
- Adding an option to randomly place a set number of agents in room is desired so the user wonâ€™t have to manually select 100 seats for example
- Survey should test usability, ergonomics and design of tool
- Make sure to have consistent formatting throughout the code
- Remove all bloat files from the git repo
